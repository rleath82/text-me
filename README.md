# text-me
A Xamarin cross-mobile application that allows users to input names/phone numbers and send SMS messages to those inputs.

This cross mobile application utilizes Twilio cloud communications platform to send SMS messages. This project was 
commissioned to me by a local business to notify customers when their orders were ready. 

Functionality of this application:

1. Create a password to access settings.
2. Create a custom text message to be sent to customers, Twilio account information, and password changing functionality in Settings.
3. Create new customers (name/phone number) to be saved in a list.
4. Select customer from list and send message or delete customer from the list.

This was not uploaded to the Apple App store due to the custom functionality needed for the local business and was instead uploaded Ad Hoc.
